# Mini C++ Projects – Continuous Learning

This repository contains a collection of **small C++ projects** built as part of my **continuous learning and mastery of C++**.

Each project focuses on strengthening core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and command-line application development.

## 📌 Projects Included

- **CLI Calculator** – Basic arithmetic operations using C++
- **Mini File Analyzer** – File handling and text analysis using C++
- **Number Guessing Game** – Logic building and user interaction
- **Temperature Converter (CLI Tool)** – Conditional logic and input handling
- **To-Do List** – Simple task management using C++ concepts

Each folder represents an **independent mini-project**.
